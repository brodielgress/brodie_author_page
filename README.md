# Hello!

I built a website featuring myself as a professional writer. I divided the website into three sections: the About section, the Portfolio section, and the Contact Form section. For this project, I concentrated mainly on designing the website's navigability and validating whether users entered text into the contact forms or not. In the future, I would like to add actual portfolio items (as live links) to the portfolio section via a carousel and validate whether the user entered in a proper email address.

###### CSS FUNCTION

My CSS function is the hamburger menu that appears in the mobile layout, which a user can toggle to show or hide the nav menu with links to the website's three web page sections.

###### MEDIA QUERIES

My tablet media query gets rid of the hamburger icon and lays the nav menu out vertically to the left of the three web page sections.

My laptop media query gets rid of the nav menu altogether and lays the three sections out side by side.

###### JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS

My first JavaScript function is the accordion menu, which allows the user to open and close the three web page sections by clicking the headers above each one.

My second JavaScript function validates the forms. Whichever fields the user leaves blank before clicking the Submit button, a prompt appears asking the user to please enter something within those fields.

## Thank You!

 Thank you, Code Louisville, for your mentorship! I have much to learn, but I've come a long way from displaying "Hello, World!"
